### compile the tomcat-8.5.8 resource and import into eclipse

- intaltall the ant
- download the tomcta resource form the  [Apache Tomcat Home](http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.8/src/)
- open your cmd terminal, and uppackage the apache-tomcat-8.5.8-src.zip , then cd apache-tomcat-8.5.8-src folder,mv "build.properties.default" "build.properties", open the build.properties and set the base.path property the value is where you want to save the download resource when you compile the tomcate code. then execute the commond "ant" to compile your tomcat resource(in "apache-tomcat-8.5.8-src") folder. and you'll see a lot of logs bilibili..., if you see the "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" at the end, congratulations!
- now you'll see two new folders, they are "output"、"tomcat-build-libs",the first is major, the second is what you set in previous step, i haven't use it anyhow...
- create a maven project in your ide named what you want, copy the "jave" and "test" folders into your new project, then a lot of errors will occur, "don't worry, be happy", you must understand my words if you play dota...
- now you'll known why we create a maven project, copy the following dependencies into your pom.xml
```xml
<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>junit</groupId>
			<artifactId>junit</artifactId>
			<version>4.12</version>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.apache.ant</groupId>
			<artifactId>ant</artifactId>
			<version>1.10.1</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>javax.xml.rpc</groupId>
			<artifactId>javax.xml.rpc-api</artifactId>
			<version>1.1.1</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.eclipse.birt.runtime.3_7_1</groupId>
			<artifactId>javax.wsdl</artifactId>
			<version>1.5.1</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.eclipse.jdt</groupId>
			<artifactId>org.eclipse.jdt.core</artifactId>
			<version>3.12.3</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.easymock</groupId>
			<artifactId>easymock</artifactId>
			<version>3.4</version>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
```
- now most of the errors have been resolved, don't happy too early, you'll find you the CookieFilter.java is a missing class, all i can say, copy、copy and copy

```
- ensure all of the code errors have been resolved, let't build the project like tomcate. copy the "apache-tomcat-8.5.8-src/webapps"、"apache-tomcat-8.5.8-src/output/build/lib"、"apache-tomcat-8.5.8-src/output/build/conf" into your project's root directory.
- the great task has been completed. run the org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap.main, open your brower, access the address "http://localhost:8080", hope you can meet the tomcat cat.
